In the on-premise deployment and private cloud markets, selling to key accounts (KA) is the core commercialization path. While in the public cloud and API services markets, a different commercialization path is needed in order to reach a broader group of customers. Building developer communities and operating product user communities is an important part of the process.

In the current WW enterprise software market, talents in product marketing and user community functions are very scarce. There are less proven practices to refer to, and there is a lack of experts in the industry with successful experiences to share their insights.

The DevGrow Wiki was created with the intention of creating a space where peers can discuss, share and learn about product marketing, user communities, and user growth knowledge, experience, and skills.

I'll throw out some bricks and expect more people to share their insights and valuable experiences.

## üé° Wiki Topics

This Wiki focuses on the following communities:

- Software product user community
- SaaS product user community

Interest groups and learning communities are somewhat different from the communities discussed in this Wiki, but the content provided in this Wiki is also somewhat informative.

## üéß Target audience

Communities, for some people, are work, for others, are a hobby. We hope this Wiki will provide you with useful information, especially for

- Software product entrepreneurs, especially for the SME user and developer community
- Initiators of open-source software projects
- People who run product communities
- Anyone curious about the community model
